# Qriously Chart Exercise

## Overview

Every day at Qriously we conduct large numbers of surveys all around the world. 
In order to help our clients make sense of the data from these surveys, we are building tools to allow them to both visualise and interact with survey data. 
We would like you to build an *interactive* chart for visualising some survey results.

Please see below for further detailed instructions to guide your submission.

## Instructions

1. Create a copy of the public `chart-exercise` repository. *Please do not fork the source repo directly as you cannot restrict access to a forked public repository*). 
 
    - [Create a new **private** repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository) called `chart-exercise`
    - [Duplicate the source repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository) (remember to replace your `{exampleuser}` in the command below)
    ```
    $ git clone --bare git@github.com:qriously/chart-exercise.git
    $ cd chart-exercise.git
    $ git push --mirror git@github.com:{exampleuser}/chart-exercise.git
    $ cd .. 
    $ rm -rf chart-exercise.git
    ```
    - Clone the duplicated repo
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:{exampleuser}/chart-exercise.git
    ```
    
1. Implement your interactive charting functionality. 
___Ideally the application itself will have some controls (buttons/checkboxes etc.) to govern what data the chart is showing, so the user can change what they are looking at.___ 

1. Include any instructions (or other useful comments) in a clearly marked text file.

1. Commit your changes locally then push to the remote repository.

1. Add the users **pc256** and **MacleanS** as [collaborators to the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

1. Drop us an email letting us know you've finished.

## Useful Information

Feel free to use any frameworks/libraries, but this is by no means required! 

To assist you we have provided an endpoint which you can call to return the survey data. This can be run in the terminal as follows ...

    $ node src/server/app.js
    
You can then submit a request to the end-point and receive some survey data back ...

    $ curl -I -X GET localhost:3456/survey
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

We suggest using an existing chart library (e.g. [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)) however this decision is left to you. Remember to include any dependencies in the `package.json`
 
The submission should be:

- Written in modern (ES6) Javascript or Typescript.
- Structured in a clear manner.
- Be visually appealing.

### Happy Coding!
